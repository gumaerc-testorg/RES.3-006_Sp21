The program offers participants the ability to conduct cutting-edge materials research with MIT faculty while simultaneously learning the fundamentals of materials science.

The MICRO initiative was developed by graduate students and teaching staff in the {{% resource_link "d98d7047-d848-4a08-a0dd-6a55370b49a7" "MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE)" %}} and was initially supported by MIT Open Learningâ€™s {{% resource_link "61130029-8f70-44db-88c8-e8743848a1ed" "J-WEL Grants in Higher Education" %}}.
